# Homemade-Hashing
My novice attempt at learning python by creating a simple hashing program <br>
I started this project as an introduction for myself to learn a bit of python while creating something useful. My goal was to use the standards paper for the SHA-256 hashing algorithm and create a simple tool that could take a string of finite length, and output the SHA-256 hash to the terminal. <br>
I followed <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/180-2/final/docs/fips180-2.pdf">this standards document</a> <br>
This was my first attempt at learning python, and coding as a whole besides some small attempts as a child. The methods I used here are doubtless not the best implementation, but I digress. <br>
What will follow here is a breakdown of my code and an explanation of how I decided upon each method, with pictures attached! <br>
